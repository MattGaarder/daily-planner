# daily-planner
a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. I used moment.js to be able have the current time and date and display on my page dynamically as formatted to my specifications using their documentation. I was also able to use javascript to compare chosen dataset values of my elements to the current time, and apply color-coded css classes based on whether the elements are in the past, present, or future. 

I was also able to put into further practice the idea of using objects to parse information to local storage using event listeners with this logic: calendarObject[textAreaId] = textAreaContent.
